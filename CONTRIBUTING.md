Thanks for your interest in classd. 
Issues, PRs and suggestions are welcome.

Before working on a PR, please consider the following:

Speed is a serious concern for this package as it is likely to be called 
a significant number of times in any project that uses it. As such, new 
features will only be accepted if they improve (or at least do not negatively 
impact) performance. To demonstrate performance differences please set up a 
JSPerf test and link to it from your issue / PR.

Tests must be added for any change or new feature before it will be accepted.
